      <h3>Technical Aspects of the Project</h3>
      <p>
          This Clean Energy Dashboard application is built using Angular, featuring a modular and component-based architecture. The frontend is developed with Angular's standalone components, ensuring efficient state management and UI updates. The data visualization is implemented using Chart.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating responsive and interactive charts. Chart.js provides flexibility and a wide variety of chart types, making it ideal for representing complex data sets in an accessible format.
      </p>
      <p>
          The backend server is powered by Node.js with Express, serving RESTful APIs for data retrieval. JWT authentication is integrated for secure access control, ensuring that users have the appropriate permissions to view the content. The data for the charts is fetched asynchronously using HTTP GET requests, leveraging Angular's HttpClient service for smooth and efficient data handling. The application follows best practices for accessibility, incorporating WCAG guidelines to ensure an inclusive user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
